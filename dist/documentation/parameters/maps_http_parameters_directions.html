<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="destination">destination</h3>
    <p>
      The place ID, address, or textual latitude/longitude value to which you
      wish to calculate directions. The options for the destination parameter
      are the same as for the origin parameter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="origin">origin</h3>
    <p>
      The place ID, address, or textual latitude/longitude value from which you
      wish to calculate directions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place IDs must be prefixed with <code>place_id:</code>. You can
          retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places API
          (including Place Autocomplete). For an example using place IDs from
          Place Autocomplete, see
          <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-directions"
            >Place Autocomplete and Directions</a
          >. For more about place IDs, see the
          <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id"

</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you pass an address, the Directions service geocodes the string and
          converts it to a latitude/longitude coordinate to calculate
          directions. This coordinate may be different from that returned by the
          Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its center.
        </p>
        <pre><code>origin=24+Sussex+Drive+Ottawa+ON
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Using place IDs is preferred over using addresses or
          latitude/longitude coordinates. Using coordinates will always result
          in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates -
          which may not be an access point to the property, or even a road that
          will quickly or safely lead to the destination.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you pass coordinates, the point will snap to the nearest road.
          Passing a place ID is preferred. If you do pass coordinates, ensure
          that no space exists between the latitude and longitude values.

            <strong>Global code</strong> is a 4 character area code and 6
            character or longer local code (849VCWC8+R9 is
            <code>849VCWC8%2BR9</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compound code</strong> is a 6 character or longer local code
            with an explicit location (CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA is
            <code>CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA</code>).

    <div class="note">
      Note: For efficiency and accuracy, use place ID's when possible. These
      ID's are uniquely explicit like a lat/lng value pair and provide geocoding
      benefits for routing such as access points and traffic variables. Unlike
      an address, ID's do not require the service to perform a search or an
      intermediate request for place details; therefore, performance is better.

<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="alternatives">alternatives</h3>
    <p>
      If set to <code>true</code>, specifies that the Directions service may
      provide more than one route alternative in the response. Note that
      providing route alternatives may increase the response time from the
      server. This is only available for requests without intermediate
      waypoints. For more information, see the
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-directions#Waypoints"
        >guide to waypoints</a
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="arrival_time">arrival_time</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies the desired time of arrival for transit directions, in seconds
      since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. You can specify either
      <code>departure_time</code> or <code>arrival_time</code>, but not both.
      Note that <code>arrival_time</code> must be specified as an integer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="avoid">avoid</h3>
    <p>
      Indicates that the calculated route(s) should avoid the indicated
      features. This parameter supports the following arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>tolls</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid toll
        roads/bridges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>highways</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid
        highways.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>ferries</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid
        ferries.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>indoor</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid
        indoor steps for walking and transit directions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's possible to request a route that avoids any combination of tolls,
      highways and ferries by passing multiple restrictions to the avoid
      parameter. For example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>avoid=tolls|highways|ferries.
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="departure_time">departure_time</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies the desired time of departure. You can specify the time as an
      integer in seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. If a
      <code>departure_time</code> later than 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z is
      specified, the API will fall back the <code>departure_time</code> to
      9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. Alternatively, you can specify a value of
      now, which sets the departure time to the current time (correct to the
      nearest second). The departure time may be specified in two cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For requests where the travel mode is transit: You can optionally
        specify one of <code>departure_time</code> or <code>arrival_time</code>.
        If neither time is specified, the <code>departure_time</code> defaults
        to now (that is, the departure time defaults to the current time).
      </li>
      <li>
        For requests where the travel mode is driving: You can specify the
        <code>departure_time</code> to receive a route and trip duration
        (response field: duration_in_traffic) that take traffic conditions into
        account. The <code>departure_time</code> must be set to the current time
        or some time in the future. It cannot be in the past.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      Note: If departure time is not specified, choice of route and duration are
      based on road network and average time-independent traffic conditions.
      Results for a given request may vary over time due to changes in the road
      network, updated average traffic conditions, and the distributed nature of
      the service. Results may also vary between nearly-equivalent routes at any
      time or frequency.
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      Note: Distance Matrix requests specifying `departure_time` when
      `mode=driving` are limited to a maximum of 100 elements per request. The
      number of origins times the number of destinations defines the number of
      elements.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="language">language</h3>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>t√©r</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="mode">mode</h3>
    <p>
      For the calculation of distances and directions, you may specify the
      transportation mode to use. By default, <code>DRIVING</code> mode is used.
      By default, directions are calculated as driving directions. The following
      travel modes are supported:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>driving</code> (default) indicates standard driving directions or
        distance using the road network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>walking</code> requests walking directions or distance via
        pedestrian paths &#x26; sidewalks (where available).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>bicycling</code> requests bicycling directions or distance via
        bicycle paths &#x26; preferred streets (where available).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>transit</code> requests directions or distance via public transit
        routes (where available). If you set the mode to transit, you can
        optionally specify either a <code>departure_time</code> or an
        <code>arrival_time</code>. If neither time is specified, the
        <code>departure_time</code> defaults to now (that is, the departure time
        defaults to the current time). You can also optionally include a
        <code>transit_mode</code> and/or a
        <code>transit_routing_preference</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      Note: Both walking and bicycling directions may sometimes not include
      clear pedestrian or bicycling paths, so these directions will return
      warnings in the returned result which you must display to the user.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="region">region</h3>
    <p>
      The region code, specified as a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains"
        >ccTLD ("top-level domain")</a
      >
      two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes,
      with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is
      "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the
      entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="traffic_model">traffic_model</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating time in traffic. This
      setting affects the value returned in the duration_in_traffic field in the
      response, which contains the predicted time in traffic based on historical
      averages. The <code>traffic_model</code> parameter may only be specified
      for driving directions where the request includes a
      <code>departure_time</code>. The available values for this parameter are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>best_guess</code> (default) indicates that the returned
        duration_in_traffic should be the best estimate of travel time given
        what is known about both historical traffic conditions and live traffic.
        Live traffic becomes more important the closer the
        <code>departure_time</code> is to now.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>pessimistic</code> indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic
        should be longer than the actual travel time on most days, though
        occasional days with particularly bad traffic conditions may exceed this
        value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>optimistic</code> indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic
        should be shorter than the actual travel time on most days, though
        occasional days with particularly good traffic conditions may be faster
        than this value.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The default value of <code>best_guess</code> will give the most useful
      predictions for the vast majority of use cases. It is possible the
      <code>best_guess</code> travel time prediction may be shorter than
      <code>optimistic</code>, or alternatively, longer than
      <code>pessimistic</code>, due to the way the
      <code>best_guess</code> prediction model integrates live traffic
      information.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="transit_mode">transit_mode</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies one or more preferred modes of transit. This parameter may only
      be specified for transit directions. The parameter supports the following
      arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>bus</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by bus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>subway</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by subway.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>train</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by train.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>tram</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by tram and light rail.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>rail</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by train, tram, light rail, and subway. This is equivalent to
        <code>transit_mode=train|tram|subway</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="transit_routing_preference">
      transit_routing_preference
    </h3>
    <p>
      Specifies preferences for transit routes. Using this parameter, you can
      bias the options returned, rather than accepting the default best route
      chosen by the API. This parameter may only be specified for transit
      directions. The parameter supports the following arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>less_walking</code> indicates that the calculated route should
        prefer limited amounts of walking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>fewer_transfers</code> indicates that the calculated route should
        prefer a limited number of transfers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="units">units</h3>
    <p>Specifies the unit system to use when displaying results.</p>
    <p>
      Directions results contain text within distance fields that may be
      displayed to the user to indicate the distance of a particular "step" of
      the route. By default, this text uses the unit system of the origin's
      country or region.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a route from "Chicago, IL" to "Toronto, ONT" will display
      results in miles, while the reverse route will display results in
      kilometers. You may override this unit system by setting one explicitly
      within the request's units parameter, passing one of the following values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>metric</code> specifies usage of the metric system. Textual
        distances are returned using kilometers and meters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>imperial</code> specifies usage of the Imperial (English) system.
        Textual distances are returned using miles and feet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      Note: this unit system setting only affects the text displayed within
      distance fields. The distance fields also contain values which are always
      expressed in meters.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="parameter-name" id="waypoints">waypoints</h3>
    <div class="caution">
      Caution: Requests using more than 10 waypoints (between 11 and 25), or
      waypoint optimization, are billed at a higher rate.

    </div>
    <p>
      Specifies an array of intermediate locations to include along the route
      between the origin and destination points as pass through or stopover
      locations. Waypoints alter a route by directing it through the specified
      location(s). The API supports waypoints for these travel modes: driving,
      walking and bicycling; not transit. You can supply one or more locations
      separated by the pipe character (<code>|</code> or <code>%7C</code>), in
      the form of a place ID, an address, or latitude/longitude coordinates. By
      default, the Directions service calculates a route using the waypoints in
      the order they are given. The precedence for parsing the value of the
      waypoint is place ID, latitude/longitude coordinates, then address.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you pass a place ID, you must prefix it with <code>place_id:</code>.
        You can retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places API
        (including Place Autocomplete). For an example using place IDs from
        Place Autocomplete, see
        <a
          href="/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-directions"
          >Place Autocomplete and Directions</a
        >. For more about place IDs, see the
        <a href="/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id"
          >Place ID overview</a
        >.
        <div class="note">
          For efficiency and accuracy, use place ID's when possible. These ID's
          are uniquely explicit like a lat/lng value pair and provide geocoding
          benefits for routing such as access points and traffic variables.
          Unlike an address, ID's do not require the service to perform a search
          or an intermediate request for place details; therefore, performance
          is better.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you pass latitude/longitude coordinates, the values go directly to
        the front-end server to calculate directions without geocoding. The
        points are snapped to roads and might not provide the accuracy your app
        needs. Use coordinates when you are confident the values truly specify
        the points your app needs for routing without regard to possible access
        points or additional geocoding details. Ensure that a comma
        (<code>%2C</code>) and not a space (<code>%20</code>) separates the
        latitude and longitude values.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you pass an address, the Directions service will geocode the string
        and convert it into latitude/longitude coordinates to calculate
        directions. If the address value is ambiguous, the value might evoke a
        search to disambiguate from similar addresses. For example, "1st Street"
        could be a complete value or a partial value for "1st street NE" or "1st
        St SE". This result may be different from that returned by the Geocoding
        API. You can avoid possible misinterpretations using place IDs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of points using the
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm"
          >Encoded Polyline Algorithm</a
        >. You will find an encoded set is useful for a large number of
        waypoints, because the URL is significantly shorter. All web services
        have a URL limit of 8192 characters.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Encoded polylines must be prefixed with <code>enc:</code> and
            followed by a colon (<code>:</code>). For example:
            <code>waypoints=enc:gfo}EtohhU:</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the
            pipe character (<code>|</code>). For example,
            <code
              >waypoints=via:enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:|

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Influence routes with stopover and pass through points</h5>
    <p>
      For each waypoint in the request, the directions response appends an entry
      to the <code>legs</code> array to provide the details for stopovers on
      that leg of the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you'd like to influence the route using waypoints without adding a
      stopover, add the prefix <code>via:</code> to the waypoint. Waypoints
      prefixed with <code>via:</code> will not add an entry to the
      <code>legs</code> array, but will route the journey through the waypoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following URL modifies the previous request such that the journey is
      routed through Lexington without stopping:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?
origin=Boston,MA&#x26;destination=Concord,MA
&#x26;waypoints=Charlestown,MA|via:Lexington,MA  
</code></pre>
    <p>
      The <code>via:</code> prefix is most effective when creating routes in
      response to the user dragging the waypoints on the map. Doing so allows
      the user to see how the final route may look in real-time and helps ensure
      that waypoints are placed in locations that are accessible to the
      Directions API.
    </p>
    <div class="caution">
      Caution: Using the `via:` prefix to avoid stopovers results in directions
      that are strict in their interpretation of the waypoint. This
      interpretation may result in severe detours on the route or `ZERO_RESULTS`
      in the response status code if the Directions API is unable to create
      directions through that point.
    </div>
    <h5>Optimize your waypoints</h5>
    <p>
      By default, the Directions service calculates a route through the provided
      waypoints in their given order. Optionally, you may pass
      <code>optimize:true</code> as the first argument within the waypoints
      parameter to allow the Directions service to optimize the provided route
      by rearranging the waypoints in a more efficient order. (This optimization
      is an application of the traveling salesperson problem.) Travel time is
      the primary factor which is optimized, but other factors such as distance,
      number of turns and many more may be taken into account when deciding
      which route is the most efficient. All waypoints must be stopovers for the
      Directions service to optimize their route.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you instruct the Directions service to optimize the order of its
      waypoints, their order will be returned in the
      <code>waypoint_order</code> field within the routes object. The
      <code>waypoint_order</code> field returns values which are zero-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following example calculates a road journey from Adelaide, South
      Australia to each of South Australia's main wine regions using route
      optimization.
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?
origin=Adelaide,SA&#x26;destination=Adelaide,SA
&#x26;waypoints=optimize:true|Barossa+Valley,SA|Clare,SA|Connawarra,SA|McLaren+Vale,SA
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Inspection of the calculated route will indicate that calculation uses
      waypoints in the following waypoint order:
    </p>
    <pre><code>"waypoint_order": [ 3, 2, 0, 1 ]
</code></pre>
