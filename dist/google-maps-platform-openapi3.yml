      description: |-
        Geolocation API returns a location and accuracy radius based on information about cell towers and WiFi nodes that the mobile client can detect. This document describes the protocol used to send this data to the server and to return a response to the client.

        Communication is done over HTTPS using POST. Both request and response are formatted as JSON, and the content type of both is `application/json`.

        You must specify a key in your request, included as the value of a`key` parameter. A `key` is your application's  API key. This key identifies your application for purposes of quota management. Learn how to [get a key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/get-api-key).

        - Elevation API
      description: |
        The Elevation API provides a simple interface to query locations on the earth for elevation data. Additionally, you may request sampled elevation data along paths, allowing you to calculate elevation changes along routes. With the Elevation API, you can develop hiking and biking applications, positioning applications, or low resolution surveying applications.

        Elevation data is available for all locations on the surface of the earth, including depth locations on the ocean floor (which return negative values). In those cases where Google does not possess exact elevation measurements at the precise location you request, the service interpolates and returns an averaged value using the four nearest locations. Elevation values are expressed relative to local mean sea level (LMSL).

        Requests to the Elevation API utilize different parameters based on whether the request is for discrete locations or for an ordered path. For discrete locations, requests for elevation return data on the specific locations passed in the request; for paths, elevation requests are instead sampled along the given path.
      parameters:
        - name: locations
          in: query
          style: pipeDelimited
          explode: false
          description: |
            Positional requests are indicated through use of the locations parameter, indicating elevation requests for the specific locations passed as latitude/longitude values.

            The locations parameter may take the following arguments:

            - A single coordinate: `locations=40.714728,-73.998672`
            - An array of coordinates separated using the pipe ('|') character: `locations=40.714728,-73.998672|-34.397,150.644`
            - A set of encoded coordinates using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm): `locations=enc:gfo}EtohhU`

            Latitude and longitude coordinate strings are defined using numerals within a comma-separated text string. For example, "40.714728,-73.998672" is a valid locations value. Latitude and longitude values must correspond to a valid location on the face of the earth. Latitudes can take any value between -90 and 90 while longitude values can take any value between -180 and 180. If you specify an invalid latitude or longitude value, your request will be rejected as a bad request.

            You may pass any number of multiple coordinates within an array or encoded polyline, while still constructing a valid URL. Note that when passing multiple coordinates, the accuracy of any returned data may be of lower resolution than when requesting data for a single coordinate.

        - Geocoding API
      description: |-
        The Geocoding API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of addresses.

        **Geocoding** is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.

        **Reverse geocoding** is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.

        You can also use the Geocoding API to find the address for a given place ID.

        To see countries currently supported by the Google Maps Platform Geocoding API, please consult the [Google Maps coverage data](https://developers.google.com/maps/coverage). The accuracy of geocoded locations may vary per country, so you should consider using the returned location_type field to determine if a good enough match has been found for the purposes of your application. Please note that the availability of geocoding data depends on our contracts with data providers, so it is subject to change.

            Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are url-escaped to `%2B` and spaces are url-escaped to `%20`):

        - Time Zone API
      description: |
        The Time Zone API provides a simple interface to request the time zone for locations on the surface of the earth, as well as the time offset from UTC for each of those locations. You request the time zone information for a specific latitude/longitude pair and date. The API returns the name of that time zone, the time offset from UTC, and the daylight savings offset.
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/language'

          description: |
            A comma-separated latitude,longitude tuple, `location=39.6034810,-119.6822510`, representing the location to look up.

            The desired time as seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. The Time Zone API uses the `timestamp` to determine whether or not Daylight Savings should be applied, based on the time zone of the `location`. 

            Note that the API does not take historical time zones into account. That is, if you specify a past timestamp, the API does not take into account the possibility that the location was previously in a different time zone.
