  A Find Place request takes a text input and returns a place. The input can be any kind of Places text data, such as a name, address, or phone number. The request must be a string. A Find Place request using non-string data such as a lat/lng coordinate or plus code generates an error.
  <div class="note">Note: If you omit the fields parameter from a Find Place request, only the place_id for the result will be returned.</div>

      The text string on which to search, for example: "restaurant" or "123 Main Street". This must be a place name, address, or category of establishments. Any other types of input can generate errors
      and are not guaranteed to return valid results. The Places API will return candidate matches based on this string and order the results based on their perceived relevance.
