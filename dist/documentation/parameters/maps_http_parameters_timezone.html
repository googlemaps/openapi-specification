    <p>
      A comma-separated latitude,longitude tuple,
      <code>location=39.6034810,-119.6822510</code>, representing the location
      to look up.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The desired time as seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. The Time
      Zone API uses the <code>timestamp</code> to determine whether or not
      Daylight Savings should be applied, based on the time zone of the
      <code>location</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the API does not take historical time zones into account. That
      is, if you specify a past timestamp, the API does not take into account
      the possibility that the location was previously in a different time zone.

    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>

        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>tér</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
