    <p>
      The path to be snapped. The path parameter accepts a list of
      latitude/longitude pairs. Latitude and longitude values should be
      separated by commas. Coordinates should be separated by the pipe
      character: "|". For example:
      <code
        >path=60.170880,24.942795|60.170879,24.942796|60.170877,24.942796</code
      >. Note: The snapping algorithm works best for points that are not too far
      apart. If you observe odd snapping behavior, try creating paths that have
      points closer together. To ensure the best snap-to-road quality, you
      should aim to provide paths on which consecutive pairs of points are
      within 300m of each other. This will also help in handling any isolated,
      long jumps between consecutive points caused by GPS signal loss, or noise.
