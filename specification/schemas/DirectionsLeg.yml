properties:
  arrival_time:
    description: Contains the estimated time of arrival for this leg. This property is only returned for transit directions.
    $ref: "./TimeZoneTextValueObject.yml"
  departure_time:
    description: Contains the estimated time of departure for this leg, specified as a Time object. The `departure_time` is only available for transit directions.
    $ref: "./TimeZoneTextValueObject.yml"
  distance:
    description: The total distance covered by this leg.
    $ref: "./TextValueObject.yml"
  duration:
    description: The total duration of this leg.
    $ref: "./TextValueObject.yml"
  duration_in_traffic:
    description: |
      Indicates the total duration of this leg. This value is an estimate of the time in traffic based on current and historical traffic conditions. See the `traffic_model` request parameter for the options you can use to request that the returned value is optimistic, pessimistic, or a best-guess estimate. The duration in traffic is returned only if all of the following are true:

      * The request does not include stopover waypoints. If the request includes waypoints, they must be prefixed with `via:` to avoid stopovers.
      * The request is specifically for driving directions—the mode parameter is set to `driving`.
      * The request includes a `departure_time` parameter.
      * Traffic conditions are available for the requested route.

  end_address:
    description: Contains the human-readable address (typically a street address) from reverse geocoding the `end_location` of this leg. This content is meant to be read as-is. Do not programmatically parse the formatted address.
    type: string
  end_location:
    description: The latitude/longitude coordinates of the given destination of this leg. Because the Directions API calculates directions between locations by using the nearest transportation option (usually a road) at the start and end points, `end_location` may be different than the provided destination of this leg if, for example, a road is not near the destination.

    type: string
    description: Formatted instructions for the leg
  polyline:

  start_address:
    description: Contains the human-readable address (typically a street address) resulting from reverse geocoding the `start_location` of this leg. This content is meant to be read as-is. Do not programmatically parse the formatted address.
    type: string
  start_location:
    description: The latitude/longitude coordinates of the origin of this leg. Because the Directions API calculates directions between locations by using the nearest transportation option (usually a road) at the start and end points, `start_location` may be different than the provided origin of this leg if, for example, a road is not near the origin.

    description: Information about traffic speed along the leg.

    description: The locations of via waypoints along this leg.
