  <div class="caution">Caution: Requests using more than 10 waypoints (between 11 and 25), or waypoint optimization, are billed at a higher rate. Learn more about billing for Google Maps Platform products.</div>

  Specifies an array of intermediate locations to include along the route between the origin and destination points as pass through or stopover locations. Waypoints alter a route by directing it through the specified location(s). The API supports waypoints for these travel modes: driving, walking and bicycling; not transit.   You can supply one or more locations separated by the pipe character (`|` or `%7C`), in the form of a place ID, an address, or latitude/longitude coordinates. By default, the Directions service calculates a route using the waypoints in the order they are given. The precedence for parsing the value of the waypoint is place ID, latitude/longitude coordinates, then address.
  * If you pass a place ID, you must prefix it with `place_id:`. You can retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places API (including Place Autocomplete). For an example using place IDs from Place Autocomplete, see [Place Autocomplete and Directions](/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-directions). For more about place IDs, see the [Place ID overview](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id).
    <div class="note">For efficiency and accuracy, use place ID's when possible. These ID's are uniquely explicit like a lat/lng value pair and provide geocoding benefits for routing such as access points and traffic variables. Unlike an address, ID's do not require the service to perform a search or an intermediate request for place details; therefore, performance is better.</div>
  * If you pass latitude/longitude coordinates, the values go directly to the front-end server to calculate directions without geocoding. The points are snapped to roads and might not provide the accuracy your app needs. Use coordinates when you are confident the values truly specify the points your app needs for routing without regard to possible access points or additional geocoding details. Ensure that a comma (`%2C`) and not a space (`%20`) separates the latitude and longitude values.
  * If you pass an address, the Directions service will geocode the string and convert it into latitude/longitude coordinates to calculate directions. If the address value is ambiguous, the value might evoke a search to disambiguate from similar addresses. For example, "1st Street" could be a complete value or a partial value for "1st street NE" or "1st St SE". This result may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API. You can avoid possible misinterpretations using place IDs.
  * Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of points using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm). You will find an encoded set is useful for a large number of waypoints, because the URL is significantly shorter. All web services have a URL limit of 8192 characters.
    * Encoded polylines must be prefixed with `enc:` and followed by a colon (`:`). For example: `waypoints=enc:gfo}EtohhU:`.
    * You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the pipe character (`|`). For example, `waypoints=via:enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:| via:enc:udymA{~bxM:`

  ##### Influence routes with stopover and pass through points

  For each waypoint in the request, the directions response appends an entry to the `legs` array to provide the details for stopovers on that leg of the journey.

  If you'd like to influence the route using waypoints without adding a stopover, add the prefix `via:` to the waypoint. Waypoints prefixed with `via:` will not add an entry to the `legs` array, but will route the journey through the waypoint.

  The following URL modifies the previous request such that the journey is routed through Lexington without stopping:

  ```
  https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?
  origin=Boston,MA&destination=Concord,MA
  &waypoints=Charlestown,MA|via:Lexington,MA  
  ```

  The `via:` prefix is most effective when creating routes in response to the user dragging the waypoints on the map. Doing so allows the user to see how the final route may look in real-time and helps ensure that waypoints are placed in locations that are accessible to the Directions API.

  <div class="caution">Caution: Using the `via:` prefix to avoid stopovers results in directions that are strict in their interpretation of the waypoint. This interpretation may result in severe detours on the route or `ZERO_RESULTS` in the response status code if the Directions API is unable to create directions through that point.</div>


  ##### Optimize your waypoints

  By default, the Directions service calculates a route through the provided waypoints in their given order. Optionally, you may pass `optimize:true` as the first argument within the waypoints parameter to allow the Directions service to optimize the provided route by rearranging the waypoints in a more efficient order. (This optimization is an application of the traveling salesperson problem.) Travel time is the primary factor which is optimized, but other factors such as distance, number of turns and many more may be taken into account when deciding which route is the most efficient. All waypoints must be stopovers for the Directions service to optimize their route.

  If you instruct the Directions service to optimize the order of its waypoints, their order will be returned in the `waypoint_order` field within the routes object. The `waypoint_order` field returns values which are zero-based.

  The following example calculates a road journey from Adelaide, South Australia to each of South Australia's main wine regions using route optimization.

  ```
  https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?
  origin=Adelaide,SA&destination=Adelaide,SA
  &waypoints=optimize:true|Barossa+Valley,SA|Clare,SA|Connawarra,SA|McLaren+Vale,SA
  ```

  Inspection of the calculated route will indicate that calculation uses waypoints in the following waypoint order:

  ```
  "waypoint_order": [ 3, 2, 0, 1 ]
  ```
