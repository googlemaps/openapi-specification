name: reviews_sort    
description: |
  The sorting method to use when returning reviews. Can be set to `most_relevant` (default) or `newest`.

  - For `most_relevant` (default), reviews are sorted by relevance; the service will bias the results to return reviews originally written in the preferred language.
  - For `newest`, reviews are sorted in chronological order; the preferred language does not affect the sort order.

  Google recommends that you display how the reviews are being sorted to the end user.
