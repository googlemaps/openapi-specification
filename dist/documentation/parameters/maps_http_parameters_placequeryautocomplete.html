<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="input">input</h3>
    <p>
      The text string on which to search. The Place Autocomplete service will
      return candidate matches based on this string and order results based on
      their perceived relevance.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="language">language</h3>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header, or the native language of the
        domain from which the request is sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>t√©r</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="location">location</h3>
    <p>
      The point around which to retrieve place information. This must be
      specified as <code>latitude,longitude</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="offset">offset</h3>
    <p>
      The position, in the input term, of the last character that the service
      uses to match predictions. For example, if the input is
      <code>Google</code> and the offset is 3, the service will match on
      <code>Goo</code>. The string determined by the offset is matched against
      the first word in the input term only. For example, if the input term is
      <code>Google abc</code> and the offset is 3, the service will attempt to
      match against <code>Goo abc</code>. If no offset is supplied, the service
      will use the whole term. The offset should generally be set to the
      position of the text caret.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="radius">radius</h3>
    <p>
      Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results. You
      may bias results to a specified circle by passing a
      <code>location</code> and a <code>radius</code> parameter. Doing so
      instructs the Places service to <em>prefer</em> showing results within
      that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be displayed.
