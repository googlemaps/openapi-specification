<h2 id="required-parameters">Required parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="place_id">place_id</h3>
    <p>
      A textual identifier that uniquelyidentifies a place, returned from a
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search"
        >Place Search</a
      >. For more information about place IDs, see the
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id"
        >place ID overview</a
      >.

  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="fields">fields</h3>
    <p>
      Use the fields parameter to specify a comma-separated list of place data
      types to return. For example:
      <code>fields=formatted_address,name,geometry</code>. Use a forward slash
      when specifying compound values. For example:
      <code>opening_hours/open_now</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and
      Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base rate, and incur no additional
      charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a higher rate. See
      the
      <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/"
        >pricing sheet</a
      >
      for more information. Attributions, <code>html_attributions</code>, are
      always returned with every call, regardless of whether the field has been
      requested.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Basic</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Basic category includes the following fields:
      <code>address_component</code>, <code>adr_address</code>,
      <code>business_status</code>, <code>formatted_address</code>,
      <code>geometry</code>, <code>icon</code>, <code>name</code>,
      <code>photo</code>, <code>place_id</code>, <code>plus_code</code>,
      <code>type</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>utc_offset</code>,
      <code>vicinity</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Contact</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Contact category includes the following fields:
      <code>formatted_phone_number</code>,
      <code>international_phone_number</code>, <code>opening_hours</code>,
      <code>website</code>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Atmosphere</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Atmosphere category includes the following fields:
      <code>price_level</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>review</code>,
      <code>user_ratings_total</code>.
    </p>
    <div class="caution">
      Caution: Place Search requests and Place Details requests do not return
      the same fields. Place Search requests return a subset of the fields that
      are returned by Place Details requests. If the field you want is not
      returned by Place Search, you can use Place Search to get a place_id, then
      use that Place ID to make a Place Details request.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="language">language</h3>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header, or the native language of the
        domain from which the request is sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>t√©r</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="region">region</h3>
    <p>
      The region code, specified as a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains"
        >ccTLD ("top-level domain")</a
      >
      two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes,
      with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is
      "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the
      entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="sessiontoken">sessiontoken</h3>
    <p>
      A random string which identifies an autocomplete
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details#session_tokens"
        >session</a
      >
      for billing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and concludes when
      they select a place and a call to Place Details is made. Each session can
      have multiple queries, followed by one place selection. The API key(s)
      used for each request within a session must belong to the same Google
      Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the token is no
      longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each session. If
      the <code>sessiontoken</code> parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a
      session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided
      (each request is billed separately).
    </p>
    <p>We recommend the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use session tokens for all autocomplete sessions.</li>
      <li>
        Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is
        recommended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that the API key(s) used for all Place Autocomplete and Place
        Details requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console
        project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session. Using the
        same token for more than one session will result in each request being
        billed individually.
      </li>
    </ul>
