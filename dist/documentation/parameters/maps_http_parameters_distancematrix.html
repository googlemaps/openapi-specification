<h3 id="required-parameters">Required Parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code id="destinations">destinations</code></p>
    <p>
      One or more locations to use as the finishing point for calculating travel
      distance and time. The options for the destinations parameter are the same
      as for the origins parameter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code id="origins">origins</code></p>
    <p>
      The starting point for calculating travel distance and time. You can
      supply one or more locations separated by the pipe character (|), in the
      form of a place ID, an address, or latitude/longitude coordinates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Place ID</strong>: If you supply a place ID, you must prefix it
        with <code>place_id:</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Address</strong>: If you pass an address, the service geocodes
        the string and converts it to a latitude/longitude coordinate to
        calculate distance. This coordinate may be different from that returned
        by the Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its
        center. Note: using place IDs is preferred over using addresses or
        latitude/longitude coordinates. Using coordinates will always result in
        the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates - which
        may not be an access point to the property, or even a road that will
        quickly or safely lead to the destination.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Coordinates</strong>: If you pass latitude/longitude
        coordinates, they they will snap to the nearest road. Passing a place ID
        is preferred. If you do pass coordinates, ensure that no space exists
        between the latitude and longitude values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plus codes</strong> must be formatted as a global code or a
        compound code. Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are
        url-escaped to %2B and spaces are url-escaped to %20):
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>global code</strong> is a 4 character area code and 6
            character or longer local code (<code>849VCWC8+R9</code> is encoded
            to <code>849VCWC8%2BR9</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>compound code</strong> is a 6 character or longer local code
            with an explicit location (<code
              >CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA</code
            >
            is encoded to <code>CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA</code>).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Encoded Polyline</strong> Alternatively, you can supply an
        encoded set of coordinates using the
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm"
          >Encoded Polyline Algorithm</a
        >. This is particularly useful if you have a large number of origin
        points, because the URL is significantly shorter when using an encoded
        polyline.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Encoded polylines must be prefixed with <code>enc:</code> and
            followed by a colon <code>:</code>. For example:
            <code>origins=enc:gfo}EtohhU:</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the
            pipe character <code>|</code>. For example:
            <code
              >origins=enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:|enc:udymA{~bxM:</code
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-parameters">Optional Parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code id="mode">mode</code></p>
    <p>
      For the calculation of distances and directions, you may specify the
      transportation mode to use. By default, <code>DRIVING</code> mode is used.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
