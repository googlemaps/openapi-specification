<p>
  Often this address is equivalent to the postal address. Note that some
  countries, such as the United Kingdom, do not allow distribution of true
  postal addresses due to licensing restrictions.
</p>
<p>
  The formatted address is logically composed of one or more address components.
  For example, the address "111 8th Avenue, New York, NY" consists of the
  following components: "111" (the street number), "8th Avenue" (the route),
  "New York" (the city) and "NY" (the US state).
</p>

  the individual address components, which the API response includes in addition
