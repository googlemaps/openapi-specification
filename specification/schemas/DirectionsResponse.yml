title: DirectionsResponse
required: [routes, status]
properties:
  geocoded_waypoints:
    description: |
      Contains an array with details about the geocoding of origin, destination and waypoints. Elements in the geocoded_waypoints array correspond, by their zero-based position, to the origin, the waypoints in the order they are specified, and the destination.

      These details will not be present for waypoints specified as textual latitude/longitude values if the service returns no results. This is because such waypoints are only reverse geocoded to obtain their representative address after a route has been found. An empty JSON object will occupy the corresponding places in the geocoded_waypoints array.
