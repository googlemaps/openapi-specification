  Positional requests are indicated through use of the locations parameter, indicating elevation requests for the specific locations passed as latitude/longitude values.

  The locations parameter may take the following arguments:

  - A single coordinate: `locations=40.714728,-73.998672`
  - An array of coordinates separated using the pipe ('|') character: `locations=40.714728,-73.998672|-34.397,150.644`
  - A set of encoded coordinates using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm): `locations=enc:gfo}EtohhU`
  
  Latitude and longitude coordinate strings are defined using numerals within a comma-separated text string. For example, "40.714728,-73.998672" is a valid locations value. Latitude and longitude values must correspond to a valid location on the face of the earth. Latitudes can take any value between -90 and 90 while longitude values can take any value between -180 and 180. If you specify an invalid latitude or longitude value, your request will be rejected as a bad request.

  You may pass any number of multiple coordinates within an array or encoded polyline, while still constructing a valid URL. Note that when passing multiple coordinates, the accuracy of any returned data may be of lower resolution than when requesting data for a single coordinate.
example: ["35,-100", "40,-110"]
