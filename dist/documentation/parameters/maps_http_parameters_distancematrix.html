<h2 id="required-parameters">Required parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="destinations">destinations</h3>
    <p>
      One or more locations to use as the finishing point for calculating travel
      distance and time. The options for the destinations parameter are the same
      as for the origins parameter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="origins">origins</h3>
    <p>
      The starting point for calculating travel distance and time. You can
      supply one or more locations separated by the pipe character (|), in the
      form of a place ID, an address, or latitude/longitude coordinates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Place ID</strong>: If you supply a place ID, you must prefix it
        with <code>place_id:</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Address</strong>: If you pass an address, the service geocodes
        the string and converts it to a latitude/longitude coordinate to
        calculate distance. This coordinate may be different from that returned
        by the Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its
        center.
        <div class="note">
          Note: using place IDs is preferred over using addresses or
          latitude/longitude coordinates. Using coordinates will always result
          in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates -
          which may not be an access point to the property, or even a road that
          will quickly or safely lead to the destination.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Coordinates</strong>: If you pass latitude/longitude
        coordinates, they they will snap to the nearest road. Passing a place ID
        is preferred. If you do pass coordinates, ensure that no space exists
        between the latitude and longitude values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plus codes</strong> must be formatted as a global code or a
        compound code. Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are
        url-escaped to %2B and spaces are url-escaped to %20):
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>global code</strong> is a 4 character area code and 6
            character or longer local code (<code>849VCWC8+R9</code> is encoded
            to <code>849VCWC8%2BR9</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>compound code</strong> is a 6 character or longer local code
            with an explicit location (<code
              >CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA</code
            >
            is encoded to <code>CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA</code>).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Encoded Polyline</strong> Alternatively, you can supply an
        encoded set of coordinates using the
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm"
          >Encoded Polyline Algorithm</a
        >. This is particularly useful if you have a large number of origin
        points, because the URL is significantly shorter when using an encoded
        polyline.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Encoded polylines must be prefixed with <code>enc:</code> and
            followed by a colon <code>:</code>. For example:
            <code>origins=enc:gfo}EtohhU:</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the
            pipe character <code>|</code>. For example:
            <pre><code>origins=enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:|enc:udymA{~bxM:
</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="arrival_time">arrival_time</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies the desired time of arrival for transit directions, in seconds
      since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. You can specify either
      <code>departure_time</code> or <code>arrival_time</code>, but not both.
      Note that <code>arrival_time</code> must be specified as an integer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="avoid">avoid</h3>
    <p>
      Distances may be calculated that adhere to certain restrictions.
      Restrictions are indicated by use of the avoid parameter, and an argument
      to that parameter indicating the restriction to avoid. The following
      restrictions are supported:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>tolls</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid toll
        roads/bridges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>highways</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid
        highways.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>ferries</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid
        ferries.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>indoor</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid
        indoor steps for walking and transit directions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      Note: The addition of restrictions does not preclude routes that include
      the restricted feature; it biases the result to more favorable routes.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="departure_time">departure_time</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies the desired time of departure. You can specify the time as an
      integer in seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. If a
      <code>departure_time</code> later than 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z is
      specified, the API will fall back the <code>departure_time</code> to
      9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. Alternatively, you can specify a value of
      now, which sets the departure time to the current time (correct to the
      nearest second). The departure time may be specified in two cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For requests where the travel mode is transit: You can optionally
        specify one of <code>departure_time</code> or <code>arrival_time</code>.
        If neither time is specified, the <code>departure_time</code> defaults
        to now (that is, the departure time defaults to the current time).
      </li>
      <li>
        For requests where the travel mode is driving: You can specify the
        <code>departure_time</code> to receive a route and trip duration
        (response field: duration_in_traffic) that take traffic conditions into
        account. The <code>departure_time</code> must be set to the current time
        or some time in the future. It cannot be in the past.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      Note: If departure time is not specified, choice of route and duration are
      based on road network and average time-independent traffic conditions.
      Results for a given request may vary over time due to changes in the road
      network, updated average traffic conditions, and the distributed nature of
      the service. Results may also vary between nearly-equivalent routes at any
      time or frequency.
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      Note: Distance Matrix requests specifying `departure_time` when
      `mode=driving` are limited to a maximum of 100 elements per request. The
      number of origins times the number of destinations defines the number of
      elements.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="language">language</h3>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header, or the native language of the
        domain from which the request is sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>t√©r</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="mode">mode</h3>
    <p>
      For the calculation of distances and directions, you may specify the
      transportation mode to use. By default, <code>DRIVING</code> mode is used.
      By default, directions are calculated as driving directions. The following
      travel modes are supported:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>DRIVING</code> (default) indicates standard driving directions or
        distance using the road network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>WALKING</code> requests walking directions or distance via
        pedestrian paths &#x26; sidewalks (where available).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>BICYCLING</code> requests bicycling directions or distance via
        bicycle paths &#x26; preferred streets (where available).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>TRANSIT</code> requests directions or distance via public transit
        routes (where available). If you set the mode to transit, you can
        optionally specify either a <code>departure_time</code> or an
        <code>arrival_time</code>. If neither time is specified, the
        <code>departure_time</code> defaults to now (that is, the departure time
        defaults to the current time). You can also optionally include a
        <code>transit_mode</code> and/or a
        <code>transit_routing_preference</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      Note: Both walking and bicycling directions may sometimes not include
      clear pedestrian or bicycling paths, so these directions will return
      warnings in the returned result which you must display to the user.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="region">region</h3>
    <p>
      The region code, specified as a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains"
        >ccTLD ("top-level domain")</a
      >
      two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes,
      with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is
      "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the
      entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="traffic_model">traffic_model</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating time in traffic. This
      setting affects the value returned in the duration_in_traffic field in the
      response, which contains the predicted time in traffic based on historical
      averages. The <code>traffic_model</code> parameter may only be specified
      for driving directions where the request includes a
      <code>departure_time</code>. The available values for this parameter are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>best_guess</code> (default) indicates that the returned
        duration_in_traffic should be the best estimate of travel time given
        what is known about both historical traffic conditions and live traffic.
        Live traffic becomes more important the closer the
        <code>departure_time</code> is to now.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>pessimistic</code> indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic
        should be longer than the actual travel time on most days, though
        occasional days with particularly bad traffic conditions may exceed this
        value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>optimistic</code> indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic
        should be shorter than the actual travel time on most days, though
        occasional days with particularly good traffic conditions may be faster
        than this value.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The default value of <code>best_guess</code> will give the most useful
      predictions for the vast majority of use cases. It is possible the
      <code>best_guess</code> travel time prediction may be shorter than
      <code>optimistic</code>, or alternatively, longer than
      <code>pessimistic</code>, due to the way the
      <code>best_guess</code> prediction model integrates live traffic
      information.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="transit_mode">transit_mode</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies one or more preferred modes of transit. This parameter may only
      be specified for transit directions. The parameter supports the following
      arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>bus</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by bus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>subway</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by subway.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>train</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by train.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>tram</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by tram and light rail.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>rail</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by train, tram, light rail, and subway. This is equivalent to
        <code>transit_mode=train|tram|subway</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="transit_routing_preference">transit_routing_preference</h3>
    <p>
      Specifies preferences for transit routes. Using this parameter, you can
      bias the options returned, rather than accepting the default best route
      chosen by the API. This parameter may only be specified for transit
      directions. The parameter supports the following arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>less_walking</code> indicates that the calculated route should
        prefer limited amounts of walking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>fewer_transfers</code> indicates that the calculated route should
        prefer a limited number of transfers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="units">units</h3>
    <p>Specifies the unit system to use when displaying results.</p>
    <p>
      Directions results contain text within distance fields that may be
      displayed to the user to indicate the distance of a particular "step" of
      the route. By default, this text uses the unit system of the origin's
      country or region.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a route from "Chicago, IL" to "Toronto, ONT" will display
      results in miles, while the reverse route will display results in
      kilometers. You may override this unit system by setting one explicitly
      within the request's units parameter, passing one of the following values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>metric</code> specifies usage of the metric system. Textual
        distances are returned using kilometers and meters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>imperial</code> specifies usage of the Imperial (English) system.
        Textual distances are returned using miles and feet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      Note: this unit system setting only affects the text displayed within
      distance fields. The distance fields also contain values which are always
      expressed in meters.
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
