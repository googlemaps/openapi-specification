  The Place Autocomplete service is a web service that returns place predictions in response to an HTTP request. The request specifies a textual search string and optional geographic bounds. The service can be used to provide autocomplete functionality for text-based geographic searches, by returning places such as businesses, addresses and points of interest as a user types.
  <div class="note">Note: You can use Place Autocomplete even without a map. If you do show a map, it must be a Google map. When you display predictions from the Place Autocomplete service without a map, you must include the ['Powered by Google'](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/policies#logo_requirementshttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/policies#logo_requirements) logo.</div>

  The Place Autocomplete service can match on full words and substrings, resolving place names, addresses, and plus codes. Applications can therefore send queries as the user types, to provide on-the-fly place predictions.

  The returned predictions are designed to be presented to the user to aid them in selecting the desired place. You can send a [Place Details](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details#PlaceDetailsRequests) request for more information about any of the places which are returned.
