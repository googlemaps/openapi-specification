<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="query">query</h3>
    <p>
      The text string on which to search, for example: "restaurant" or "123 Main
      Street". The Google Places service will return candidate matches based on
      this string and order the results based on their perceived relevance.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="language">language</h3>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header, or the native language of the
        domain from which the request is sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>tér</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="location">location</h3>
    <p>
      The point around which to retrieve place information. This must be
      specified as <code>latitude,longitude</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="maxprice">maxprice</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
      values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
      The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
      region.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="minprice">minprice</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
      values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
      The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
      region.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="opennow">opennow</h3>
    <p>
      Returns only those places that are open for business at the time the query
      is sent. Places that do not specify opening hours in the Google Places
      database will not be returned if you include this parameter in your query.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="pagetoken">pagetoken</h3>
    <p>
      Returns up to 20 results from a previously run search. Setting a
      <code>pagetoken</code> parameter will execute a search with the same
      parameters used previously — all parameters other than pagetoken will be
      ignored.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="radius">radius</h3>
    <p>
      Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="region">region</h3>
    <p>
      The region code, specified as a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains"
        >ccTLD ("top-level domain")</a
      >
      two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes,
      with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is
      "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the
      entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="type">type</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts the results to places matching the specified type. Only one type
      may be specified (if more than one type is provided, all types following
      the first entry are ignored). See the list of
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types"
        >supported types</a
      >.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      Note: Adding both `keyword` and `type` with the same value
      (`keyword=cafe&type=cafe` or `keyword=parking&type=parking`) can yield
      `ZERO_RESULTS`.
    </div>
  </li>
