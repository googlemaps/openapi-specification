												"description": "The Place Photo service, part of the Places API, is a read- only API that allows you to add high quality photographic content to your application. The Place Photo service gives you access to the millions of photos stored in the Places database. When you get place information using a Place Details request, photo references will be returned for relevant photographic content. Find Place, Nearby Search, and Text Search requests also return a single photo reference per place, when relevant. Using the Photo service you can then access the referenced photos and resize the image to the optimal size for your application.\n\nPhotos returned by the Photo service are sourced from a variety of locations, including business owners and user contributed photos. In most cases, these photos can be used without attribution, or will have the required attribution included as a part of the image. However, if the returned photo element includes a value in the html_attributions field, you will have to include the additional attribution in your application wherever you display the image.\n"

For more information on the fields that are unavailable in a Place Search request, see <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-data-fields#places-api-fields-support\">Places API fields support</a>.</div>\n\nUse the fields parameter to specify a comma-separated list of place data types to return. For example: `fields=formatted_address,name,geometry`. Use a forward slash when specifying compound values. For example: `opening_hours/open_now`.\n\nFields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base rate, and incur no additional charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a higher rate. See the [pricing sheet](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing/) for more information. Attributions, `html_attributions`, are always returned with every call, regardless of whether the field has been requested.\n\n**Basic**\n\nThe Basic category includes the following fields: `address_components`, `adr_address`, `business_status`, `formatted_address`, `geometry`, `icon`, `icon_mask_base_uri`, `icon_background_color`, `name`, `permanently_closed` ([deprecated](https://developers.google.com/maps/deprecations)), `photo`, `place_id`, `plus_code`, `type`, `url`, `utc_offset`, `vicinity`, `wheelchair_accessible_entrance`.\n\n**Contact**\n\nThe Contact category includes the following fields: `current_opening_hours`, `formatted_phone_number`, `international_phone_number`, `opening_hours`, `secondary_opening_hours`, `website`\n\n**Atmosphere**\n\nThe Atmosphere category includes the following fields: `curbside_pickup`, `delivery`, `dine_in`, `editorial_summary`, `price_level`, `rating`, `reservable`, `reviews`, `serves_beer`, `serves_breakfast`, `serves_brunch`, `serves_dinner`, `serves_lunch`, `serves_vegetarian_food`, `serves_wine`, `takeout`, `user_ratings_total`.\n",

Use coordinates when you are confident the values truly specify the points your app needs for routing without regard to possible access points or additional geocoding details. Ensure that a comma (`%2C`) and not a space (`%20`) separates the latitude and longitude values.\n* If you pass an address, the Directions service will geocode the string and convert it into latitude/longitude coordinates to calculate directions. If the address value is ambiguous, the value might evoke a search to disambiguate from similar addresses. For example, \"1st Street\" could be a complete value or a partial value for \"1st street NE\" or \"1st St SE\". This result may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API. You can avoid possible misinterpretations using place IDs.\n* Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of points using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm). You will find an encoded set is useful for a large number of waypoints, because the URL is significantly shorter.

For example: `waypoints=enc:gfo}EtohhU:`.\n  * You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the pipe character (`|`). For example, `waypoints=via:enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:| via:enc:udymA{~bxM:`\n\n##### Influence routes with stopover and pass through points\n\nFor each waypoint in the request, the directions response appends an entry to the `legs` array to provide the details for stopovers on that leg of the journey.\n\nIf you'd like to influence the route using waypoints without adding a stopover, add the prefix `via:` to the waypoint. Waypoints prefixed with `via:` will not add an entry to the `legs` array, but will route the journey through the waypoint.\n\nThe following URL modifies the previous request such that the journey is routed through Lexington without stopping:\n\n```\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?\norigin=Boston,MA&destination=Concord,MA\n&waypoints=Charlestown,MA|via:Lexington,MA  \n```\n\nThe `via:` prefix is most effective when creating routes in response to the user dragging the waypoints on the map. Doing so allows the user to see how the final route may look in real-time and helps ensure that waypoints are placed in locations that are accessible to the Directions API.\n\n<div class=\"caution\">Caution: Using the `via:` prefix to avoid stopovers results in directions that are strict in their interpretation of the waypoint. This interpretation may result in severe detours on the route or `ZERO_RESULTS` in the response status code if the Directions API is unable to create directions through that point.</div>\n\n\n##### Optimize your waypoints\n\nBy default, the Directions service calculates a route through the provided waypoints in their given order.

You can supply one or more locations separated by the pipe character (`|` or `%7C`), in the form of a place ID, an address, or latitude/longitude coordinates. By default, the Directions service calculates a route using the waypoints in the order they are given. The precedence for parsing the value of the waypoint is place ID, latitude/longitude coordinates, then address.\n* If you pass a place ID, you must prefix it with `place_id:`.

The points are snapped to roads and might not provide the accuracy your app needs. Use coordinates when you are confident the values truly specify the points your app needs for routing without regard to possible access points or additional geocoding details. Ensure that a comma (`%2C`) and not a space (`%20`) separates the latitude and longitude values.\n* If you pass an address, the Directions service will geocode the string and convert it into latitude/longitude coordinates to calculate directions. If the address value is ambiguous, the value might evoke a search to disambiguate from similar addresses. For example, \"1st Street\" could be a complete value or a partial value for \"1st street NE\" or \"1st St SE\". This result may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API. You can avoid possible misinterpretations using place IDs.\n* Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of points using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm). You will find an encoded set is useful for a large number of waypoints, because the URL is significantly shorter. All web services have a URL limit of 8192 characters.\n  * Encoded polylines must be prefixed with `enc:` and followed by a colon (`:`). For example: `waypoints=enc:gfo}EtohhU:`.\n  * You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the pipe character (`|`). For example, `waypoints=via:enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:| via:enc:udymA{~bxM:`\n\n##### Influence routes with stopover and pass through points\n\nFor each waypoint in the request, the directions response appends an entry to the `legs` array to provide the details for stopovers on that leg of the journey.\n\nIf you'd like to influence the route using waypoints without adding a stopover, add the prefix `via:` to the waypoint. Waypoints prefixed with `via:` will not add an entry to the `legs` array, but will route the journey through the waypoint.\n\nThe following URL modifies the previous request such that the journey is routed through Lexington without stopping:\n\n```\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?\norigin=Boston,MA&destination=Concord,MA\n&waypoints=Charlestown,MA|via:Lexington,MA  \n```\n\nThe `via:` prefix is most effective when creating routes in response to the user dragging the waypoints on the map. Doing so allows the user to see how the final route may look in real-time and helps ensure that waypoints are placed in locations that are accessible to the Directions API.\n\n<div class=\"caution\">Caution: Using the `via:` prefix to avoid stopovers results in directions that are strict in their interpretation of the waypoint. This interpretation may result in severe detours on the route or `ZERO_RESULTS` in the response status code if the Directions API is unable to create directions through that point.</div>\n\n\n##### Optimize your waypoints\n\nBy default, the Directions service calculates a route through the provided waypoints in their given order. Optionally, you may pass `optimize:true` as the first argument within the waypoints parameter to allow the Directions service to optimize the provided route by rearranging the waypoints in a more efficient order.
