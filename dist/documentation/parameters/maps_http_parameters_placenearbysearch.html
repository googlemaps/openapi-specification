<h2 id="required-parameters">Required parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="location">location</h3>
    <p>
      The point around which to retrieve place information. This must be
      specified as <code>latitude,longitude</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="fields">fields</h3>
    <p>
      Use the fields parameter to specify a comma-separated list of place data
      types to return. For example:
      <code>fields=formatted_address,name,geometry</code>. Use a forward slash
      when specifying compound values. For example:
      <code>opening_hours/open_now</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and
      Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base rate, and incur no additional
      charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a higher rate. See
      the
      <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/"
        >pricing sheet</a
      >
      for more information. Attributions, <code>html_attributions</code>, are
      always returned with every call, regardless of whether the field has been
      requested.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Basic</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Basic category includes the following fields:
      <code>address_component</code>, <code>adr_address</code>,
      <code>business_status</code>, <code>formatted_address</code>,
      <code>geometry</code>, <code>icon</code>, <code>name</code>,
      <code>photo</code>, <code>place_id</code>, <code>plus_code</code>,

      The Contact category includes the following fields:
      <code>formatted_phone_number</code>,

      <code>user_ratings_total</code>.
    </p>
    <div class="caution">
      Caution: Place Search requests and Place Details requests do not return
      the same fields. Place Search requests return a subset of the fields that
      are returned by Place Details requests. If the field you want is not
      returned by Place Search, you can use Place Search to get a place_id, then
      use that Place ID to make a Place Details request.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="keyword">keyword</h3>
    <p>
      A term to be matched against all content that Google has indexed for this
      place, including but not limited to name, type, and address, as well as
      customer reviews and other third-party content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="language">language</h3>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header, or the native language of the
        domain from which the request is sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>tér</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="maxprice">maxprice</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
      values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
      The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
      region.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="minprice">minprice</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
      values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
      The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
      region.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="name">name</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Not Recommended</em> A term to be matched against all content that
      Google has indexed for this place. Equivalent to <code>keyword</code>. The
      <code>name</code> field is no longer restricted to place names. Values in
      this field are combined with values in the keyword field and passed as
      part of the same search string. We recommend using only the
      <code>keyword</code> parameter for all search terms.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="opennow">opennow</h3>
    <p>
      Returns only those places that are open for business at the time the query
      is sent. Places that do not specify opening hours in the Google Places
      database will not be returned if you include this parameter in your query.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="pagetoken">pagetoken</h3>
    <p>
      Returns up to 20 results from a previously run search. Setting a
      <code>pagetoken</code> parameter will execute a search with the same
      parameters used previously — all parameters other than pagetoken will be
      ignored.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="radius">radius</h3>
    <p>
      Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="rankby">rankby</h3>
    <p>Specifies the order in which results are listed. Possible values are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>prominence</code> (default). This option sorts results based on
        their importance. Ranking will favor prominent places within the set
        radius over nearby places that match but that are less prominent.
        Prominence can be affected by a place's ranking in Google's index,
        global popularity, and other factors. When prominence is specified, the
        <code>radius</code> parameter is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>distance</code>. This option biases search results in ascending
        order by their distance from the specified location. When
        <code>distance</code> is specified, one or more of <code>keyword</code>,
        <code>name</code>, or <code>type</code> is required.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="type">type</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts the results to places matching the specified type. Only one type
      may be specified (if more than one type is provided, all types following
      the first entry are ignored). See the list of
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types"
        >supported types</a
      >.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      Note: Adding both `keyword` and `type` with the same value
      (`keyword=cafe&type=cafe` or `keyword=parking&type=parking`) can yield
      `ZERO_RESULTS`.
