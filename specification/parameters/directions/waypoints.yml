name: waypoints
description: |
  Specifies an array of intermediate locations to include along the route between the origin and destination points as pass through or stopover locations. Waypoints alter a route by directing it through the specified location(s). The API supports waypoints for these travel modes: driving, walking and bicycling; not transit. You can specify waypoints using the following values:
  * Place ID: The unique value specific to a location (`ChIJGwVKWe5w44kRcr4b9E25-Go`).
  * Address string (`Charlestown, Boston,MA`)
  * Latitude/longitude coordinates (lat/lng): an explicit value pair. (`-34.92788%2C138.60008` comma, no space)
  * Encoded polyline that can be specified by a set of any of the above. (`enc:lexeF{~wsZejrPjtye@:`)
