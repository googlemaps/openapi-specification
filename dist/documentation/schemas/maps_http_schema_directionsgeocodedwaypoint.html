            Indicates that the geocoder did not return an exact match for the
            original request, though it was able to match part of the requested
            address. You may wish to examine the original request for
            misspellings and/or an incomplete address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Partial matches most often occur for street addresses that do not
            exist within the locality you pass in the request. Partial matches
            may also be returned when a request matches two or more locations in
            the same locality. For example, "21 Henr St, Bristol, UK" will
            return a partial match for both Henry Street and Henrietta Street.
            Note that if a request includes a misspelled address component, the
            geocoding service may suggest an alternative address. Suggestions
            triggered in this way will also be marked as a partial match.

            <li>
              <code>street_address</code> indicates a precise street address.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>route</code> indicates a named route (such as "US 101").
            </li>
            <li>

              of two major roads.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>political</code> indicates a political entity. Usually, this
              type indicates a polygon of some civil administration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>country</code> indicates the national political entity, and
              is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder.

            <li>
              <code>administrative_area_level_1</code> indicates a first-order
              civil entity below the country level. Within the United States,
              these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit
              these administrative levels. In most cases,
              administrative_area_level_1 short names will closely match ISO
              3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however
              this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a
              variety of signals and location data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>administrative_area_level_2</code> indicates a second-order
              civil entity below the country level. Within the United States,
              these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit
              these administrative levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>administrative_area_level_3</code> indicates a third-order
              civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor
              civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative
              levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>administrative_area_level_4</code> indicates a fourth-order
              civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor
              civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative
              levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>administrative_area_level_5</code> indicates a fifth-order
              civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor
              civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative
              levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>colloquial_area</code> indicates a commonly-used alternative
              name for the entity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>locality</code> indicates an incorporated city or town
              political entity.

            <li>
              <code>sublocality</code> indicates a first-order civil entity
              below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the
              additional types: sublocality_level_1 to sublocality_level_5. Each
              sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a
              smaller geographic area.
            </li>
            <li><code>neighborhood</code> indicates a named neighborhood</li>
            <li>

            <li>
              <code>plus_code</code> indicates an encoded location reference,
              derived from latitude and longitude. Plus codes can be used as a
              replacement for street addresses in places where they do not exist
              (where buildings are not numbered or streets are not named). See
              <a href="https://plus.codes/"

            </li>
            <li>
              <code>postal_code</code> indicates a postal code as used to

              Building" or "Eiffel Tower".
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            An empty list of types indicates there are no known types for the
