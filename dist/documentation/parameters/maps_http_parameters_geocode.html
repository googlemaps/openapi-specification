<h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4 id="address"><code>address</code></h4>
    <p>
      The street address or plus code that you want to geocode. Specify
      addresses in accordance with the format used by the national postal
      service of the country concerned. Additional address elements such as
      business names and unit, suite or floor numbers should be avoided. Street
      address elements should be delimited by spaces (shown here as url-escaped
      to <code>%20</code>):
    </p>
    <p><code>address=24%20Sussex%20Drive%20Ottawa%20ON</code></p>
    <p>
      Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are url-escaped to
      <code>%2B</code> and spaces are url-escaped to <code>%20</code>):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        global code is a 4 character area code and 6 character or longer local
        code (<code>849VCWC8+R9</code> is <code>849VCWC8%2BR9</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        compound code is a 6 character or longer local code with an explicit
        location (<code>CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA</code> is
        <code>CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA</code>).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="bounds"><code>bounds</code></h4>
    <p>
      The bounding box of the viewport within which to bias geocode results more
      prominently. This parameter will only influence, not fully restrict,
      results from the geocoder. - name: locations in: query
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="components"><code>components</code></h4>
    <p>
      A components filter with elements separated by a pipe (|). The components
      filter is also accepted as an optional parameter if an address is
      provided. Each element in the components filter consists of a
      component:value pair, and fully restricts the results from the geocoder.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="language"><code>language</code></h4>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header, or the native language of the
        domain from which the request is sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>t√©r</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="latlng"><code>latlng</code></h4>
    <p>
      The street address that you want to geocode, in the format used by the
      national postal service of the country concerned. Additional address
      elements such as business names and unit, suite or floor numbers should be
      avoided.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="region"><code>region</code></h4>
    <p>
      The region code, specified as a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains"
        >ccTLD ("top-level domain")</a
      >
      two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes,
      with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is
      "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the
      entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
