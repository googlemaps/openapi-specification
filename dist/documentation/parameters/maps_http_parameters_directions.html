<h3 id="required-parameters">Required parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4 id="destination">destination</h4>
    <p>
      The place ID, address, or textual latitude/longitude value to which you
      wish to calculate directions. The options for the destination parameter
      are the same as for the origin parameter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="origin">origin</h4>
    <p>
      The place ID, address, or textual latitude/longitude value from which you
      wish to calculate directions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place IDs must be prefixed with <code>place_id:</code>. You can
          retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places API
          (including Place Autocomplete). For an example using place IDs from
          Place Autocomplete, see
          <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-directions"
            >Place Autocomplete and Directions</a
          >. For more about place IDs, see the
          <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id"
            >Place ID overview</a
          >.
        </p>
        <pre><code>origin=place_id:ChIJ3S-JXmauEmsRUcIaWtf4MzE
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you pass an address, the Directions service geocodes the string and
          converts it to a latitude/longitude coordinate to calculate
          directions. This coordinate may be different from that returned by the
          Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its center.
        </p>
        <pre><code>origin=24+Sussex+Drive+Ottawa+ON
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Using place IDs is preferred over using addresses or
          latitude/longitude coordinates. Using coordinates will always result
          in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates -
          which may not be an access point to the property, or even a road that
          will quickly or safely lead to the destination.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you pass coordinates, the point will snap to the nearest road.
          Passing a place ID is preferred. If you do pass coordinates, ensure
          that no space exists between the latitude and longitude values.
        </p>
        <pre><code>origin=41.43206,-81.38992
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Plus codes must be formatted as a global code or a compound code.
          Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are url-escaped to
          <code>%2B</code> and spaces are url-escaped to <code>%20</code>).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Global code</strong> is a 4 character area code and 6
            character or longer local code (849VCWC8+R9 is
            <code>849VCWC8%2BR9</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compound code</strong> is a 6 character or longer local code
            with an explicit location (CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA is
            <code>CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA</code>).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      Note: For efficiency and accuracy, use place ID's when possible. These
      ID's are uniquely explicit like a lat/lng value pair and provide geocoding
      benefits for routing such as access points and traffic variables. Unlike
      an address, ID's do not require the service to perform a search or an
      intermediate request for place details; therefore, performance is better.
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4 id="alternatives">alternatives</h4>
    <p>
      If set to <code>true</code>, specifies that the Directions service may
      provide more than one route alternative in the response. Note that
      providing route alternatives may increase the response time from the
      server. This is only available for requests without intermediate
      waypoints. For more information, see the
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-directions#Waypoints"
        >guide to waypoints</a
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="arrival_time">arrival_time</h4>
    <p>
      Specifies the desired time of arrival for transit directions, in seconds
      since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. You can specify either
      <code>departure_time</code> or <code>arrival_time</code>, but not both.
      Note that <code>arrival_time</code> must be specified as an integer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="avoid">avoid</h4>
    <p>
      Indicates that the calculated route(s) should avoid the indicated
      features. This parameter supports the following arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>tolls</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid toll
        roads/bridges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>highways</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid
        highways.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>ferries</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid
        ferries.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>indoor</code> indicates that the calculated route should avoid
        indoor steps for walking and transit directions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="departure_time">departure_time</h4>
    <p>
      Specifies the desired time of departure. You can specify the time as an
      integer in seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. If a
      <code>departure_time</code> later than 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z is
      specified, the API will fall back the <code>departure_time</code> to
      9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. Alternatively, you can specify a value of
      now, which sets the departure time to the current time (correct to the
      nearest second). The departure time may be specified in two cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For requests where the travel mode is transit: You can optionally
        specify one of <code>departure_time</code> or <code>arrival_time</code>.
        If neither time is specified, the <code>departure_time</code> defaults
        to now (that is, the departure time defaults to the current time).
      </li>
      <li>
        For requests where the travel mode is driving: You can specify the
        <code>departure_time</code> to receive a route and trip duration
        (response field: duration_in_traffic) that take traffic conditions into
        account. The <code>departure_time</code> must be set to the current time
        or some time in the future. It cannot be in the past.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: If departure time is not specified, choice of route and duration are
      based on road network and average time-independent traffic conditions.
      Results for a given request may vary over time due to changes in the road
      network, updated average traffic conditions, and the distributed nature of
      the service. Results may also vary between nearly-equivalent routes at any
      time or frequency.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="language">language</h4>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header, or the native language of the
        domain from which the request is sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>t√©r</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="mode">mode</h4>
    <p>
      For the calculation of distances and directions, you may specify the
      transportation mode to use. By default, <code>DRIVING</code> mode is used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="region">region</h4>
    <p>
      The region code, specified as a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains"
        >ccTLD ("top-level domain")</a
      >
      two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes,
      with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is
      "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the
      entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="traffic_model">traffic_model</h4>
    <p>
      Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating time in traffic. This
      setting affects the value returned in the duration_in_traffic field in the
      response, which contains the predicted time in traffic based on historical
      averages. The <code>traffic_model</code> parameter may only be specified
      for driving directions where the request includes a
      <code>departure_time</code>. The available values for this parameter are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>best_guess</code> (default) indicates that the returned
        duration_in_traffic should be the best estimate of travel time given
        what is known about both historical traffic conditions and live traffic.
        Live traffic becomes more important the closer the
        <code>departure_time</code> is to now.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>pessimistic</code> indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic
        should be longer than the actual travel time on most days, though
        occasional days with particularly bad traffic conditions may exceed this
        value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>optimistic</code> indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic
        should be shorter than the actual travel time on most days, though
        occasional days with particularly good traffic conditions may be faster
        than this value.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The default value of <code>best_guess</code> will give the most useful
      predictions for the vast majority of use cases. It is possible the
      <code>best_guess</code> travel time prediction may be shorter than
      <code>optimistic</code>, or alternatively, longer than
      <code>pessimistic</code>, due to the way the
      <code>best_guess</code> prediction model integrates live traffic
      information.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="transit_mode">transit_mode</h4>
    <p>
      Specifies one or more preferred modes of transit. This parameter may only
      be specified for transit directions. The parameter supports the following
      arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>bus</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by bus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>subway</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by subway.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>train</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by train.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>tram</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by tram and light rail.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>rail</code> indicates that the calculated route should prefer
        travel by train, tram, light rail, and subway. This is equivalent to
        <code>transit_mode=train|tram|subway</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="transit_routing_preference">transit_routing_preference</h4>
    <p>
      Specifies preferences for transit routes. Using this parameter, you can
      bias the options returned, rather than accepting the default best route
      chosen by the API. This parameter may only be specified for transit
      directions. The parameter supports the following arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>less_walking</code> indicates that the calculated route should
        prefer limited amounts of walking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>fewer_transfers</code> indicates that the calculated route should
        prefer a limited number of transfers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="units">units</h4>
    <p>Specifies the unit system to use when displaying results.</p>
    <p>
      Directions results contain text within distance fields that may be
      displayed to the user to indicate the distance of a particular "step" of
      the route. By default, this text uses the unit system of the origin's
      country or region.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a route from "Chicago, IL" to "Toronto, ONT" will display
      results in miles, while the reverse route will display results in
      kilometers. You may override this unit system by setting one explicitly
      within the request's units parameter, passing one of the following values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>metric</code> specifies usage of the metric system. Textual
        distances are returned using kilometers and meters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>imperial</code> specifies usage of the Imperial (English) system.
        Textual distances are returned using miles and feet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: this unit system setting only affects the text displayed within
      distance fields. The distance fields also contain values which are always
      expressed in meters.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="waypoints">waypoints</h4>
    <p>
      Specifies an array of intermediate locations to include along the route
      between the origin and destination points as pass through or stopover
      locations. Waypoints alter a route by directing it through the specified
      location(s). The API supports waypoints for these travel modes: driving,
      walking and bicycling; not transit. You can specify waypoints using the
      following values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Place ID: The unique value specific to a location
        (<code>ChIJGwVKWe5w44kRcr4b9E25-Go</code>).
      </li>
      <li>Address string (<code>Charlestown, Boston,MA</code>)</li>
      <li>
        Latitude/longitude coordinates (lat/lng): an explicit value pair. (<code
          >-34.92788%2C138.60008</code
        >
        comma, no space)
      </li>
      <li>
        Encoded polyline that can be specified by a set of any of the above.
        (<code>enc:lexeF{~wsZejrPjtye@:</code>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
