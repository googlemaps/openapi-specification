<h2 id="required-parameters">Required parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="location">location</h3>
    <p>
      The point around which to retrieve place information. This must be
      specified as <code>latitude,longitude</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="keyword">keyword</h3>
    <p>
      A term to be matched against all content that Google has indexed for this
      place, including but not limited to name, type, and address, as well as
      customer reviews and other third-party content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="language">language</h3>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header, or the native language of the
        domain from which the request is sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>tér</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="maxprice">maxprice</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
      values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
      The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
      region.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="minprice">minprice</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
      values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
      The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
      region.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="name">name</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Not Recommended</em> A term to be matched against all content that
      Google has indexed for this place. Equivalent to <code>keyword</code>. The
      <code>name</code> field is no longer restricted to place names. Values in
      this field are combined with values in the keyword field and passed as
      part of the same search string. We recommend using only the
      <code>keyword</code> parameter for all search terms.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="opennow">opennow</h3>
    <p>
      Returns only those places that are open for business at the time the query
      is sent. Places that do not specify opening hours in the Google Places
      database will not be returned if you include this parameter in your query.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="pagetoken">pagetoken</h3>
    <p>
      Returns up to 20 results from a previously run search. Setting a
      <code>pagetoken</code> parameter will execute a search with the same
      parameters used previously — all parameters other than pagetoken will be
      ignored.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="radius">radius</h3>
    <p>
      Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results. You
      may bias results to a specified circle by passing a
      <code>location</code> and a <code>radius</code> parameter. Doing so
      instructs the Places service to <em>prefer</em> showing results within
      that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on
      the type of search and other parameters.
    </p>

      <li>
        Nearby Search:
        <ul>
          <li>with <code>keyword</code> or <code>name</code>: 50,000 meters</li>

            <ul>
              <li><code>rankby=prominence</code> (default): 50,000 meters</li>
              <li>
                <code>rankby=distance</code>: A few kilometers depending on
                density of area

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="rankby">rankby</h3>
    <p>Specifies the order in which results are listed. Possible values are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>prominence</code> (default). This option sorts results based on
        their importance. Ranking will favor prominent places within the set
        radius over nearby places that match but that are less prominent.
        Prominence can be affected by a place's ranking in Google's index,
        global popularity, and other factors. When prominence is specified, the
        <code>radius</code> parameter is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>distance</code>. This option biases search results in ascending
        order by their distance from the specified location. When
        <code>distance</code> is specified, one or more of <code>keyword</code>,
        <code>name</code>, or <code>type</code> is required.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="type">type</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts the results to places matching the specified type. Only one type
      may be specified (if more than one type is provided, all types following
      the first entry are ignored). See the list of
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types"
        >supported types</a
      >.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      Note: Adding both `keyword` and `type` with the same value
      (`keyword=cafe&type=cafe` or `keyword=parking&type=parking`) can yield
      `ZERO_RESULTS`.
