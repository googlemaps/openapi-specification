  formatted_address:
    description: |
      A string containing the human-readable address of this place.

      Often this address is equivalent to the postal address. Note that some countries, such as the United Kingdom, do not allow distribution of true postal addresses due to licensing restrictions.

      The formatted address is logically composed of one or more address components. For example, the address "111 8th Avenue, New York, NY" consists of the following components: "111" (the street number), "8th Avenue" (the route), "New York" (the city) and "NY" (the US state).

      Do not parse the formatted address programmatically. Instead you should use the individual address components, which the API response includes in addition to the formatted address field.
