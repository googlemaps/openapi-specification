<h2 id="reverse-geocoding-required-parameters">Reverse geocoding required parameters</h2>

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="latlng">latlng</h3>

    The street address that you want to geocode, in the format used by the national postal service of the country concerned. Additional address elements such as business names and unit, suite or floor numbers should be avoided.

<h2 id="reverse-geocoding-optional-parameters">Reverse geocoding optional parameters</h2>

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="language">language</h3>

    The language in which to return results.

    -   See the [list of supported languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive.
    -   If `language` is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the `Accept-Language` header.
    -   The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.
    -   If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.
    -   The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another. For example, *utca* and *t√©r* are synonyms for street in Hungarian.

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="location_type">location_type</h3>

    A filter of one or more location types, separated by a pipe (`|`). If the parameter contains multiple location types, the API returns all addresses that match any of the types. A note about processing: The `location_type` parameter does not restrict the search to the specified location type(s). Rather, the `location_type` acts as a post-search filter: the API fetches all results for the specified latlng, then discards those results that do not match the specified location type(s). The following values are supported:

    -   `APPROXIMATE` returns only the addresses that are characterized as approximate.
    -   `GEOMETRIC_CENTER` returns only geometric centers of a location such as a polyline (for example, a street) or polygon (region).
    -   `RANGE_INTERPOLATED` returns only the addresses that reflect an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two precise points (such as intersections). An interpolated range generally indicates that rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address.
    -   `ROOFTOP` returns only the addresses for which Google has location information accurate down to street address precision.

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="region">region</h3>

    The region code, specified as a [ccTLD ("top-level domain")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains) two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="result_type">result_type</h3>

    A filter of one or more address types, separated by a pipe (|). If the parameter contains multiple address types, the API returns all addresses that match any of the types. A note about processing: The `result_type` parameter does not restrict the search to the specified address type(s). Rather, the `result_type` acts as a post-search filter: the API fetches all results for the specified `latlng`, then discards those results that do not match the specified address type(s).The following values are supported:

    -   `administrative_area_level_1` indicates a first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level\_1   \* `short` names will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety of signals and location data.
    -   `administrative_area_level_2` indicates a second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
    -   `administrative_area_level_3` indicates a third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
    -   `administrative_area_level_4` indicates a fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
    -   `administrative_area_level_5` indicates a fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
    -   `airport` indicates an airport.
    -   `colloquial_area` indicates a commonly-used alternative name for the entity.
    -   `country` indicates the national political entity, and is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder.
    -   `intersection` indicates a major intersection, usually of two major roads.
    -   `locality` indicates an incorporated city or town political entity.
    -   `natural_feature` indicates a prominent natural feature.
    -   `neighborhood` indicates a named neighborhood
    -   `park` indicates a named park.
    -   `plus_code` indicates an encoded location reference, derived from latitude and longitude. Plus codes can be used as a replacement for street addresses in places where they do not exist (where buildings are not numbered or streets are not named). See <https://plus.codes/> for details.
    -   `point_of_interest` indicates a named point of interest. Typically, these "POI"s are prominent local entities that don't easily fit in another category, such as "Empire State Building" or "Eiffel Tower".
    -   `political` indicates a political entity. Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil administration.
    -   `postal_code` indicates a postal code as used to address postal mail within the country.
    -   `premise` indicates a named location, usually a building or collection of buildings with a common name
    -   `route` indicates a named route (such as "US 101").
    -   `street_address` indicates a precise street address.
    -   `sublocality` indicates a first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the additional types: `sublocality_level_1` to `sublocality_level_5`. Each sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller geographic area.
    -   `subpremise` indicates a first-order entity below a named location, usually a singular building within a collection of buildings with a common name
