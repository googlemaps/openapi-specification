  The Google Places API Text Search Service is a web service that returns information about a set of places based on a string â€” for example "pizza in New York" or "shoe stores near Ottawa" or "123 Main Street". The service responds with a list of places matching the text string and any location bias that has been set.

  The service is especially useful for making [ambiguous address](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/best-practices) queries in an automated system, and non-address components of the string may match businesses as well as addresses. Examples of ambiguous address queries are incomplete addresses, poorly formatted addresses, or a request that includes non-address components such as business names.

  The search response will include a list of places. You can send a Place Details request for more information about any of the places in the response.
