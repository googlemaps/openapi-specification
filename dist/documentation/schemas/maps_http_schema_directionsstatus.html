<p>
  The status field within the Directions response object contains the status of
  the request, and may contain debugging information to help you track down why
  the Directions service failed. The status field may contain the following
  values:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>OK</code> indicates the response contains a valid result.</li>
  <li>
    <code>NOT_FOUND</code> indicates at least one of the locations specified in
    the request's origin, destination, or waypoints could not be geocoded.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>ZERO_RESULTS</code> indicates no route could be found between the
    origin and destination.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>MAX_WAYPOINTS_EXCEEDED</code> indicates that too many waypoints were
    provided in the request. For applications using the Directions API as a web
    service, or the directions service in the Maps JavaScript API, the maximum
    allowed number of waypoints is 25, plus the origin and destination.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>MAX_ROUTE_LENGTH_EXCEEDED</code> indicates the requested route is too
    long and cannot be processed. This error occurs when more complex directions
    are returned. Try reducing the number of waypoints, turns, or instructions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>INVALID_REQUEST</code> indicates that the provided request was
    invalid. Common causes of this status include an invalid parameter or
    parameter value.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>OVER_DAILY_LIMIT</code> indicates any of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>The API key is missing or invalid.</li>
      <li>Billing has not been enabled on your account.</li>
      <li>A self-imposed usage cap has been exceeded.</li>
      <li>
        The provided method of payment is no longer valid (for example, a credit
        card has expired).
      </li>
    </ul>
    See the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#over-limit-key-error"
      >Maps FAQ</a
    >
    to learn how to fix this.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>OVER_QUERY_LIMIT</code> indicates the service has received too many
    requests from your application within the allowed time period.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>REQUEST_DENIED</code> indicates that the service denied use of the
    directions service by your application.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>UNKNOWN_ERROR</code> indicates a directions request could not be
    processed due to a server error. The request may succeed if you try again.
  </li>
</ul>
