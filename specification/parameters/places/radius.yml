name: radius
description: |
  Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results. You may bias results to a specified circle by passing a `location` and a `radius` parameter. Doing so instructs the Places service to _prefer_ showing results within that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be displayed.
  
  The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on the type of search and other parameters.

  * Autocomplete: 50,000 meters
  * Nearby Search: 
    * with `keyword` or `name`: 50,000 meters
    * without `keyword` or `name`
      * Up to 50,000 meters, adjusted dynamically based on area density, independent of `rank_by` parameter.
      * When using `rank_by=distance`, the radius parameter will not be accepted, and will result in an `INVALID_REQUEST`.
  * Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters
  * Text Search: 50,000 meters
