<h2 id="required-parameters">Required parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="input">input</h3>
    <p>
      The text string on which to search. The Place Autocomplete service will
      return candidate matches based on this string and order results based on
      their perceived relevance.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="components">components</h3>
    <p>
      A grouping of places to which you would like to restrict your results.
      Currently, you can use components to filter by up to 5 countries.
      Countries must be passed as a two character, ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 compatible
      country code. For example: <code>components=country:fr</code> would
      restrict your results to places within France. Multiple countries must be
      passed as multiple <code>country:XX</code> filters, with the pipe
      character <code>|</code> as a separator. For example:
      <code
        >components=country:us|country:pr|country:vi|country:gu|country:mp</code
      >
      would restrict your results to places within the United States and its
      unincorporated organized territories.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you receive unexpected results with a country
      code, verify that you are using a code which includes the countries,
      dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest you
      intend. You can find code information at

  <li>
    <h3 id="language">language</h3>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header, or the native language of the
        domain from which the request is sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>t√©r</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="location">location</h3>
    <p>
      The point around which to retrieve place information. This must be
      specified as <code>latitude,longitude</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="offset">offset</h3>
    <p>
      The position, in the input term, of the last character that the service
      uses to match predictions. For example, if the input is
      <code>Google</code> and the offset is 3, the service will match on
      <code>Goo</code>. The string determined by the offset is matched against
      the first word in the input term only. For example, if the input term is
      <code>Google abc</code> and the offset is 3, the service will attempt to
      match against <code>Goo abc</code>. If no offset is supplied, the service
      will use the whole term. The offset should generally be set to the
      position of the text caret.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="origin">origin</h3>
    <p>
      The origin point from which to calculate straight-line distance to the
      destination (returned as <code>distance_meters</code>). If this value is
      omitted, straight-line distance will not be returned. Must be specified as
      <code>latitude,longitude</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="radius">radius</h3>
    <p>
      Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="sessiontoken">sessiontoken</h3>
    <p>
      A random string which identifies an autocomplete
      <a
        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details#session_tokens"
        >session</a
      >
      for billing purposes. Use this for Place Details requests that are called
      following an autocomplete request in the same user session.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="strictbounds">strictbounds</h3>
    <p>
      Returns only those places that are strictly within the region defined by
      <code>location</code> and <code>radius</code>. This is a restriction,
      rather than a bias, meaning that results outside this region will not be
      returned even if they match the user input.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="types">types</h3>
    <p>
      You may restrict results from a Place Autocomplete request to be of a
      certain type by passing a types parameter. The parameter specifies a type
      or a type collection, as listed in the supported types below. If nothing
      is specified, all types are returned. In general only a single type is
      allowed. The exception is that you can safely mix the geocode and
      establishment types, but note that this will have the same effect as
      specifying no types. The supported types are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>geocode</code> instructs the Place Autocomplete service to return
        only geocoding results, rather than business results. Generally, you use
        this request to disambiguate results where the location specified may be
        indeterminate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>address</code> instructs the Place Autocomplete service to return
        only geocoding results with a precise address. Generally, you use this
        request when you know the user will be looking for a fully specified
        address.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>establishment</code> instructs the Place Autocomplete service to
        return only business results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>(regions)</code> type collection instructs the Places service to
        return any result matching the following types:
        <ul>
          <li><code>locality</code></li>
          <li><code>sublocality</code></li>
          <li><code>postal_code</code></li>
          <li><code>country</code></li>
          <li><code>administrative_area_level_1</code></li>
          <li><code>administrative_area_level_2</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>(cities)</code> type collection instructs the Places service to
        return results that match <code>locality</code> or
        <code>administrative_area_level_3</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
