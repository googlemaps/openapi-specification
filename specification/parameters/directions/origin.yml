  The place ID, address, or textual latitude/longitude value from which you wish to calculate directions.
  * Place IDs must be prefixed with `place_id:`. You can retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places API (including Place Autocomplete). For an example using place IDs from Place Autocomplete, see [Place Autocomplete and Directions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-directions). For more about place IDs, see the [Place ID overview](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id).
    
    ```
    origin=place_id:ChIJ3S-JXmauEmsRUcIaWtf4MzE
    ```
    
  * If you pass an address, the Directions service geocodes the string and converts it to a latitude/longitude coordinate to calculate directions. This coordinate may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its center.
    
    ```
    origin=24+Sussex+Drive+Ottawa+ON
    ```
    
    Using place IDs is preferred over using addresses or latitude/longitude coordinates. Using coordinates will always result in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates - which may not be an access point to the property, or even a road that will quickly or safely lead to the destination.
  * If you pass coordinates, the point will snap to the nearest road. Passing a place ID is preferred. If you do pass coordinates, ensure that no space exists between the latitude and longitude values.
    
    ```
    origin=41.43206,-81.38992
    ```

  * Plus codes must be formatted as a global code or a compound code. Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are url-escaped to `%2B` and spaces are url-escaped to `%20`). 
    
    * **Global code** is a 4 character area code and 6 character or longer local code (849VCWC8+R9 is `849VCWC8%2BR9`). 
    * **Compound code** is a 6 character or longer local code with an explicit location (CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA is `CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA`).

  <div class="note">Note: For efficiency and accuracy, use place ID's when possible. These ID's are uniquely explicit like a lat/lng value pair and provide geocoding benefits for routing such as access points and traffic variables. Unlike an address, ID's do not require the service to perform a search or an intermediate request for place details; therefore, performance is better.</div>
