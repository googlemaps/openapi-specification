<h2 id="required-parameters">Required parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="location">location</h3>
    <p>
      The point around which to retrieve place information. This must be
      specified as <code>latitude,longitude</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="keyword">keyword</h3>
    <p>
      The text string on which to search, for example: "restaurant" or "123 Main
      Street". This must a place name, address, or category of establishments.
      Any other types of input can generate errors and are not guaranteed to
      return valid results. The Google Places service will return candidate
      matches based on this string and order the results based on their
      perceived relevance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explicitly including location information using this parameter may
      conflict with the location, radius, and rankby parameters, causing
      unexpected results.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this parameter is omitted, places with a business_status of
      CLOSED_TEMPORARILY or CLOSED_PERMANENTLY will not be returned.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="language">language</h3>
    <p>The language in which to return results.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        See the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport"
          >list of supported languages</a
        >. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
        exhaustive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>language</code> is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
        preferred language as specified in the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header.
      </li>
      <li>
        The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
        both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
        addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
        the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
        addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
        all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
        component.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
        closest match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
        the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
        geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
        such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
        valid in one language but not in another. For example, <em>utca</em> and
        <em>tér</em> are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="maxprice">maxprice</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
      values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
      The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
      region.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="minprice">minprice</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
      values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
      The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
      region.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="name">name</h3>
    <p>
      Deprecated. Equivalent to <code>keyword</code>. Values in this field are
      combined with values in the <code>keyword</code> field and passed as part
      of the same search string.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="opennow">opennow</h3>
    <p>
      Returns only those places that are open for business at the time the query
      is sent. Places that do not specify opening hours in the Google Places
      database will not be returned if you include this parameter in your query.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="pagetoken">pagetoken</h3>
    <p>
      Returns up to 20 results from a previously run search. Setting a
      <code>pagetoken</code> parameter will execute a search with the same
      parameters used previously — all parameters other than pagetoken will be
      ignored.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="radius">radius</h3>
    <p>
      Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results. You
      may bias results to a specified circle by passing a
      <code>location</code> and a <code>radius</code> parameter. Doing so
      instructs the Places service to <em>prefer</em> showing results within
      that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on
      the type of search and other parameters.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Autocomplete: 50,000 meters</li>
      <li>
        Nearby Search:
        <ul>
          <li>with <code>keyword</code> or <code>name</code>: 50,000 meters</li>
          <li>
            without <code>keyword</code> or <code>name</code>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Up to 50,000 meters, adjusted dynamically based on area density,
                independent of <code>rankby</code> parameter.
              </li>
              <li>
                When using <code>rankby=distance</code>, the radius parameter
                will not be accepted, and will result in an
                <code>INVALID_REQUEST</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      <li>Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters</li>
      <li>Text Search: 50,000 meters</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="rankby">rankby</h3>
    <p>Specifies the order in which results are listed. Possible values are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>prominence</code> (default). This option sorts results based on
        their importance. Ranking will favor prominent places within the set
        radius over nearby places that match but that are less prominent.
        Prominence can be affected by a place's ranking in Google's index,
        global popularity, and other factors. When prominence is specified, the
        <code>radius</code> parameter is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>distance</code>. This option biases search results in ascending
        order by their distance from the specified location. When
        <code>distance</code> is specified, one or more of <code>keyword</code>,
        <code>name</code>, or <code>type</code> is required and
        <code>radius</code> is disallowed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="type">type</h3>
    <p>
      Restricts the results to places matching the specified type. Only one type
      may be specified. If more than one type is provided, all types following
      the first entry are ignored.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>type=hospital|pharmacy|doctor</code> becomes
        <code>type=hospital</code>
      </li>
      <li><code>type=hospital,pharmacy,doctor</code> is ignored entirely</li>
    </ul>
