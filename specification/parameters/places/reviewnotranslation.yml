description: |

  Specify `reviews_no_translations=true` to disable translation of reviews; specify `reviews_no_translations=false` to enable translation of reviews. Reviews are returned in their original language.
  
  If omitted, or passed with no value, translation of reviews is enabled. If the `language` parameter was specified in the request, use the specified language as the preferred language for translation. If `language` is omitted, the API attempts to use the `Accept-Language` header as the preferred language.
