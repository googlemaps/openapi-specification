  You can restrict results from a Place Autocomplete request to be of a certain type by passing the `types` parameter. This parameter specifies a type or a type collection, as listed in [Place Types](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types). If nothing is specified, all types are returned.

  For the value of the `types` parameter you can specify either:
  * Up to five values from [Table 1](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table1) or [Table 2](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table2). For multiple values, separate each value with a `|` (vertical bar). For example:

    `types=book_store|cafe`

  * Any supported filter in [Table 3](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table3). You can safely mix the `geocode` and `establishment` types. You cannot mix type collections (`address`, `(cities)` or `(regions)`) with any other type, or an error occurs.

  The request will be rejected with an `INVALID_REQUEST` error if:

  * More than five types are specified.
  * Any unrecognized types are present.
  * Any types from in [Table 1](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table1) or [Table 2](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table2) are mixed with any of the filters in [Table 3](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table3).
