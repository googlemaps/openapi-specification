description: |
  The desired time as seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. The Time Zone API uses the `timestamp` to determine whether or not Daylight Savings should be applied, based on the time zone of the `location`. 
  
  Note that the API does not take historical time zones into account. That is, if you specify a past timestamp, the API does not take into account the possibility that the location was previously in a different time zone.
