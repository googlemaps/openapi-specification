        Stores additional data about the specified location. The following values are currently supported:

        - "ROOFTOP" indicates that the returned result is a precise geocode for which we have location information accurate down to street address precision.
        - "RANGE_INTERPOLATED" indicates that the returned result reflects an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two precise points (such as intersections). Interpolated results are generally returned when rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address.
        - "GEOMETRIC_CENTER" indicates that the returned result is the geometric center of a result such as a polyline (for example, a street) or polygon (region).
        - "APPROXIMATE" indicates that the returned result is approximate.

PlusCode:
  type: object
  description: An encoded location reference, derived from latitude and longitude coordinates, that represents an area, 1/8000th of a degree by 1/8000th of a degree (about 14m x 14m at the equator) or smaller. Plus codes can be used as a replacement for street addresses in places where they do not exist (where buildings are not numbered or streets are not named).
