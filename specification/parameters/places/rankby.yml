name: rankby
description: |
  Specifies the order in which results are listed. Possible values are:
  - `prominence` (default). This option sorts results based on their importance. Ranking will favor prominent places within the set radius over nearby places that match but that are less prominent. Prominence can be affected by a place's ranking in Google's index, global popularity, and other factors. When prominence is specified, the `radius` parameter is required.
  - `distance`. This option biases search results in ascending order by their distance from the specified location. When `distance` is specified, one or more of `keyword`, `name`, or `type` is required and `radius` is disallowed.
